# TaxCollector
Combines the expenses incurred  from different accounts of savings/checking/credit of bofa, chase and barclays.
We need to download the statements and put them into a folder(s) 12 for each year of each account.
The advantage is we download the code,and use our own machines so our data is protected.
The statements are in pdf format unique to each bank [Bofa,Chase,Barclays] for now.
